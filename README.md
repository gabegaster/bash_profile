bash_profile
============

my bash_profile and other bash-ish scripts I use, open-sourced.

If you are a bash-pro, please suggest things I should be doing. 

If you are new to bash, please feel free to ask questions about why I do certain things because maybe I shouldn't be doing those things.

If you see a bug, please let me know. 

If you have any helpful suggestions, I'm all ears.

Please fork. Thanks for stopping by.
